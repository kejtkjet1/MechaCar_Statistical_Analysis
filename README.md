R and R Studio project

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Analysis of the data using R Studio. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- We are now able to filter the UFO sighting data by filtering  the results. 
- We can filter by following:
    - date
    - city
    - state
    - country 
    - shape

- The user can enter the above filter criteria in the image box below

## Summary

- The new design is quite nice and allows us to search by multiple different criteria. We should add a feature that allows us to clear the filter instantly without having to manualy change all the filter options.
